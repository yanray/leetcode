## Product of Array Except Self

### Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

### Problem Description 

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

```
Example 1: 

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

```

**Constraint:** It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

**Note:** Please solve it without division and in O(n).

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
