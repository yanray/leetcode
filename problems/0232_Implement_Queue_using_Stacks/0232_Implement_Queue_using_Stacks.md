## Range Sum of BST

### Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/

### Problem Description 

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

* push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
* pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
* peek() -- Get the front element.
* empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.


```
Example 1:

MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false

```

**Note:**

* You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
* You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

```python

        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.stack = []
        

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        """
        Push element x to the back of queue.
        """
        self.stack.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        """
        Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element.
        """
        if self.stack:
            return self.stack.pop(0)

    def peek(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the front element.
        """
        if self.stack:
            return self.stack[0]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns whether the queue is empty.
        """
        if self.stack:
            return False
        else:
            return True


# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```
