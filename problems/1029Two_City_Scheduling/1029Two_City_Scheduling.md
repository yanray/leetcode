## Next Greater Element I

### Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/

### Problem Description 

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.

```

```
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.

```

**Note:**

1. All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
2. The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

[Approach 1] (80%) 

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        hash_dict = {}
        
        for i in range(len(nums2)):
            hash_dict[nums2[i]] = i
            
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            index = hash_dict[nums1[i]] + 1
            
            while index < len(nums2) and nums1[i] > nums2[index]:
                index += 1
                
            if index == len(nums2):
                nums1[i] = -1
            else:
                nums1[i] = nums2[index]
                
        return nums1
```

[Approach 2] (%)  (O(m + n))

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        next_greater = {}
        stack = []
        for n in nums2:
            while stack and stack[-1]<n:
                next_greater[stack.pop()] = n
            stack.append(n)
        return [next_greater.get(n, -1) for n in nums1]
